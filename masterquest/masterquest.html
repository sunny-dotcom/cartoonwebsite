                With the Olivine City Gym temporarily out of commission, our heroes are off to the Whirl Cup Competition—and Misty wants in on the action! Resuming their journey, they find that Jessie, James, and Meowth aren’t the only members of Team Rocket they need to worry about, though that dastardly trio still has a few tricks up their collective sleeve. After a heated battle with the final Gym Leader, Ash moves on to the Silver Conference, but does he have the mettle to take on his old rival, Gary?
